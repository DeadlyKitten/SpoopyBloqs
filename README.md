# Spoopy Bloqs

Accidentally miss that one bloq because of lag? *(or maybe you just missed, I don't judge)*
Either way, take another swing with the **Spoopy Bloqs** mod! With this mod by your side, you'll have two (yes, two) chances at every note!
But beware, much like when you reanimate a human, they don't come back quite the same way.
<br /><br />

## Instructions

Simply turn on the mod by enabling the modifier on the left panel when selecting a song. No really, it's that easy!
<br /><br />

### Note

For some reason I can't explain, hitsounds don't work correctly in Single Saber Mode. 

*maybe it's haunted*
